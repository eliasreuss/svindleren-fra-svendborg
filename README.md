# Svindleren fra Svendborg

A mobile-first social deduction party game played in-person using a single device passed around a circle. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build steps.

## How It Works

1. **Add players** and set the number of imposters ("svindlere")
2. **Pass the phone around** — each player taps their name to secretly view their word
3. **Civilians** all see the same word. **Imposters** see a slightly different word
4. **Nobody sees their role** — players must figure out during discussion if they belong to the majority or minority
5. **Discuss, deceive, and deduce** — then reveal the roles to see who fooled who
